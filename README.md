# Automationexercise web-test project

Test cases from [here](https://automationexercise.com/test_cases) are realised in this project with using Cucumber, JUnit 5 and Serenity. 

## Running the tests under Maven

To run the tests with Maven, open a command window and run:

    mvn clean verify

## Viewing the reports

Both of the commands provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/starter.steps.serenity` directory. Go take a look!
